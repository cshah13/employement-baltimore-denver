# Employement in Baltimore, Maryland and Denver, Colorado 
Analysis of employement in Baltimore, Maryland and Denver, Colorado

## Background Information
This project aims to analyze employement in Baltimore and Denver, because I am interested in ways to tackle poverty and increase opportunities for success in communities. I chose these specific cities because Denver is my hometown and Baltimore is my collegetown.

_When analyzing [a news article from the Baltimore Sun about Baltimore's unemployement problem](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-0115-baltimore-unemployment-20200115-urcqmi467vcqnlw4usgtonzwja-story.html),it is clear that many individuals in Baltimore do not have the same opportunities that many people accross the country have. The article highlights that six years after graduating high school, many people in the class of 2009 had a median income of $15,000, which makes it extremely difficult to pay for basic neccesities. This information motivated me to understand the economic situation in Denver, my hometown. An [article published in FiveThirtyEight by ABC News](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sponsored/denvers-tech-boom/), emphasizes that Denver has a booming tech industry. Jobs in the tech sector are expected to grow by 13.1% before 2026. This data analysis aims to identify metrics to determine why two major cities have very different economic success._
