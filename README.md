# Employement in Baltimore, Maryland and Denver, Colorado 
Analysis of workforce opportunities in Baltimore and Denver. Metrics analyzed include: employment rates, household income, job density, and college graduation rates.
## Background Information
This project aims to analyze employement  in Baltimore and Denver, because I enjoy learning about ways to improve equity in communities. I chose these specific cities because Denver is my hometown and Baltimore is my collegetown.
