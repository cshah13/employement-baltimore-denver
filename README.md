# Comparing Workforce Opportunities in Baltimore, Maryland and Denver, Colorado with Opportunity Atlas Data
Analysis of workforce opportunities in Baltimore, Maryland and Denver, Colorado

## Background Information
This project aims to analyze employement in Baltimore and Denver, because I am interested in ways to tackle poverty and increase opportunities for success in communities. I chose these specific cities because Denver is my hometown and Baltimore is my collegetown.

When analyzing [a news article from the Baltimore Sun about Baltimore's unemployement problem](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-0115-baltimore-unemployment-20200115-urcqmi467vcqnlw4usgtonzwja-story.html), it is clear that many individuals in Baltimore do not have the same opportunities that many people across the country have. The article highlights that six years after graduating high school, many people in the class of 2009 had a median income of $15,000, which makes it extremely difficult to pay for basic neccesities. This information motivated me to understand the lifestyle situation in Denver, my hometown. An [article published by The Denver Channel](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-ranked-no-2-on-u-s-news-worlds-report-list-of-best-places-to-live), states that Denver was ranked the second best place to live in the United States according to a US News & World Report. The city ranked 8.8/10 for desirability and 7/10 for quality of life. The city is known to have a rising tech industry with an expected increase in tech jobs. This project aims to analyze data from [The Opportunity Atlas](https://opportunityatlas.org) to understand the differences in workforce opportunities that are causing livelihood differences in these two major cities.

## Business Question
